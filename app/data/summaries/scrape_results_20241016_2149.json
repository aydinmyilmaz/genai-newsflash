        "Full article text": "OpenAI is broadening access to Advanced Voice Mode, a feature of ChatGPT that allows you to speak more naturally with the AI model. It allows you to interrupt its responses midsentence, and it can sense and interpret your emotions from your tone of voice and adjust its responses accordingly. These features were teased back in May when OpenAI unveiled GPT-4o, but they were not released until July— and then just to an invite-only group. Users who’ve been able to try it have largely described the model as an impressively fast, dynamic, and realistic voice assistant—which has made its limited availability particularly frustrating to some other OpenAI users. Today is the first time OpenAI has promised to bring the new voice mode to a wide range of users. \n\nWhat can it do? Though ChatGPT currently offers a standard voice mode to paid users, its interactions can be clunky. In the mobile app, for example, you can’t interrupt the model’s often long-winded responses with your voice, only with a tap on the screen. The new version fixes that, and also promises to modify its responses on the basis of the emotion it’s sensing from your voice. As with other versions of ChatGPT, users can personalize the voice mode by asking the model to remember facts about themselves. The new mode also has improved its pronunciation of words in non-English languages. \n\nThe update also adds new voices. Shortly after the launch of GPT-4o, OpenAI was criticized for the similarity between the female voice in its demo videos, named Sky, and that of Scarlett Johansson, who played an AI love interest in the movie Her. OpenAI then removed the voice. Now it has launched five new voices, named Arbor, Maple, Sol, Spruce, and Vale, which will be available in both the standard and advanced voice modes. \n\nWho can access it and when? For now, OpenAI is rolling out access to Advanced Voice Mode to Plus users, who pay $20 per month for a premium version, and Team users, who pay $30 per month and have higher message limits. The next group to receive access will be those in the Enterprise and Edu tiers. The exact timing, though, is vague; an OpenAI spokesperson says the company will “gradually roll out access to all Plus and Team users and will roll out to Enterprise and Edu tiers starting next week.” The company hasn’t committed to a firm deadline for when all users in these categories will have access. A message in the ChatGPT app indicates that all Plus users will have access by “the end of fall.” There are geographic limitations. The new feature is not yet available in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, or Liechtenstein. There is no immediate plan to release Advanced Voice Mode to free users. (The standard mode remains available to all paid users.) \n\nWhat steps have been taken to make sure it’s safe? As the company noted upon the initial release in July and again emphasized this week, Advanced Voice Mode has been safety-tested by external experts “who collectively speak a total of 45 different languages, and represent 29 different geographies.” The GPT-4o system card details how the underlying model handles issues like generating violent or erotic speech, imitating voices without their consent, or generating copyrighted content. Still, OpenAI’s models are not open-source. Compared with such models, which are more transparent about their training data and the “model weights” that govern how the AI produces responses, OpenAI’s closed-source models are harder for independent researchers to evaluate from the perspective of safety, bias, and harm.",
        "Short summary": "OpenAI has expanded access to its Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, allowing users to interact more naturally with the AI by interrupting responses and having the model adjust based on the user's emotional tone. Initially teased with the GPT-4o model, this feature aims to enhance user experience by providing a more dynamic and realistic voice assistant. The new voice mode is currently available to Plus and Team users, with plans for broader access in the future. OpenAI has also introduced new voice options and emphasized safety measures in the model's deployment.",

        "Full article text": "OpenAI has analyzed millions of conversations with its hit chatbot and found that ChatGPT will produce a harmful gender or racial stereotype based on a user’s name in around one in 1000 responses on average, and as many as one in 100 responses in the worst case. OpenAI says it wants to make its models even better. Evaluating them is the first step. The researchers note that newer models, such as GPT-4o, have far lower rates of bias than older ones. With GPT-3.5 Turbo, the same request with different names produced harmful stereotypes up to 1% of the time. In contrast, GPT-4o produced harmful stereotypes around 0.1% of the time. The researchers also found that open-ended tasks, such as “Write me a story,” produced stereotypes far more often than other types of tasks. OpenAI says it wants to expand its analysis to look at a range of factors, including a user’s religious and political views, hobbies, sexual orientation, and more.",
        "Short summary": "OpenAI's recent research reveals that ChatGPT can produce harmful gender and racial stereotypes based on users' names, with a frequency of about one in 1000 responses on average. The study highlights the importance of evaluating AI models for bias, especially as ChatGPT is widely used by millions.

        "article_title": "Mistral releases new AI models optimized for laptops and phones",
        "full_article_text": "French AI startup Mistral has released its first generative AI models designed to be run on edge devices, like laptops and phones. The new family of models, which Mistral is calling “Les Ministraux,” can be used or tuned for a variety of applications, from basic text generation to working in conjunction with more capable models to complete tasks. Two Les Ministraux models are available — Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B — both of which have a context window of 128,000 tokens, meaning they can ingest roughly the length of a 50-page book. “Our most innovative customers and partners have increasingly been asking for local, privacy-first inference for critical applications such as on-device translation, internet-less smart assistants, local analytics, and autonomous robotics,” Mistral writes in a blog post. “Les Ministraux were built to provide a compute-efficient and low-latency solution for these scenarios.” Ministral 8B is available for download as of today — albeit strictly for research purposes. Mistral is requiring devs and companies interested in Ministral 8B or Ministral 3B self-deployment setups to contact it for a commercial license. Otherwise, devs can use Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B through Mistral’s cloud platform, Le Platforme, and other clouds with which the startup has partnered in the coming weeks. Ministral 8B costs 10 cents per million output/input tokens (~750,000 words), while Ministral 3B costs 4 cents per million output/input tokens. There’s been a trend toward small models, lately, which are cheaper and quicker to train, fine-tune, and run than their larger counterparts. Google continues to add models to its small model family, while Microsoft offers its collection of models. In the most recent refresh of its Llama suite, Meta introduced several small models optimized for edge hardware. Mistral claims that Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B outperform comparable Llama and Gemma models — as well as its own Mistral 7B — on several AI benchmarks designed to evaluate instruction following and problem solving capabilities. Paris-based Mistral, which recently raised $640 million in venture capital, continues to gradually expand its AI product portfolio. Over the past few months, the company has launched a free service for developers to test its models, an SDK to let customers fine-tune those models, and new models including a generative model for code called Codestral. Co-founded by alumni from Meta and Google’s DeepMind, Mistral’s stated mission is to create flagship models that rival the best-performing models today, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude — and ideally make money in the process. While the “making money” bit is proving to be challenging, Mistral reportedly began to generate revenue this summer.",

        "Article title": "Concourse is building AI to automate financial tasks",
        "Full article text": "In a typical organization, finance is one of the most important functions. Yet teams are often bogged down by manual workflows. According to a survey by Paylocity, an HR software provider, 38% of finance teams spend more than a fourth of their time on manual jobs, like reviewing invoices. Matthieu Hafemeister, an ex-fintech investor at Andreessen Horowitz, says he’s seen many finance orgs struggle to scale up as a result of all the work they’re doing by hand. “The status quo for finance is countless point solutions that are cobbled together within the finance department,” Hafemeister told TechCrunch. “Excel continues to be the lowest common denominator, limiting the promise of automation.” To Hafemeister’s point, most finance departments are indeed heavily reliant on spreadsheets. One survey found that 82% still use Excel files for budgeting, forecasting, and other core financial planning activities. After experiencing these frustrations firsthand while leading growth at fintech firm Jeeves, Hafemeister decided to team up with Ted Michaels, Jeeves’ previous head of finance and an old friend, to launch a platform to automate financial tasks. Called Concourse, the platform connects to a business’ financial systems to let finance teams retrieve and analyze data, generate charts, and ask ad hoc questions such as “What’s our non-GAAP revenue?” “Concourse can proactively surface insights that allow finance teams to be better prepared by enabling them to stay ahead of trends,” Hafemeister said. “Instead of a tool that tries to improve the speed or efficiency of completing a task, Concourse can be given discrete tasks to do entirely on its own. Concourse’s back-end dashboard shows the status of its various AI integrations and settings to fine-tune them. Now, finance automation isn’t exactly new technology. Linq recently emerged from stealth with AI to automate aspects of research for financial analysts. Ledge and Doopla are also building a range of finance-specific generative modeling tools. But what makes Concourse different, according to Hafemeister, is its ability to execute financial workflows with “complex, multi-step operations.” For example, the platform can retrieve data from a company’s NetSuite dashboard to download CSV files, then copy that data to an Excel spreadsheet. “We leverage large language models to do what they are best suited for and pair them with more traditional methods of data analysis,” Hafemeister explained. There’s great interest in AI for finance. One poll found that 58% of finance teams are now using some form of AI technology, up 21% from 2023. Grand View Research estimates that the “AI in fintech” segment, worth $9.45 billion three years ago, is growing 16.5% annually. But to stand a chance of making a dent in the market for finance automation tech, Concourse will have to demonstrate its product’s ROI — a challenging feat. Gartner found that showing or estimating the value of AI is a top barrier to adopting it for close to half of companies. Concourse will also have to assuage potential customers’ fears of AI-introduced errors and hallucinations. In a poll of U.K.-based executives by HR specialist Peninsula, 40% said inaccuracies from AI tools were a key concern, followed by concerns around data confidentiality. Hafemeister said that Concourse employs “a variety of tools and techniques” for fact-checking and validation to try to ensure its AI performs tasks as intended. He added that Concourse doesn’t use companies’ data to train its AI models — at least not without explicit permission — and that the platform only collects data customers share with it. “Data accuracy is paramount in finance, where answers are typically either entirely correct or entirely incorrect,” Hafemeister said. “As such, at Concourse we’ve spent a lot of time and effort on delivering AI that can accurately perform the task it’s been assigned. We also take data privacy and security very seriously, and have built Concourse using industry best practices.” Folks seem willing to take Hafemeister at his word. Concourse, which is still in beta ahead of a broader launch planned for next year, has several customers, including Instabase and Shef, and $4.7 million in capital. Hafemeister’s ex-employer, a16z, has invested in the startup, along with Y Combinator, CRV, and BoxGroup. Hafemeister says the focus at the moment is product development and growing New York-based Concourse’s six-person staff. “We raised money to hire more engineers, build out more workflows that our AI can take on, increase coverage on data integrations, and start to scale our go-to-market function,” he said. “The strong focus on engineering recruiting is to hire backend, machine learning, and AI engineers.”",
        "Short summary": "Concourse is a new platform aimed at automating financial tasks, addressing the inefficiencies faced by finance teams that often rely on manual workflows and spreadsheets. Founded by Matthieu Hafemeister and Ted Michaels, the platform connects to existing financial systems, allowing teams to retrieve and analyze data, generate insights, and execute complex financial workflows. With a growing interest in AI for finance, Concourse aims to differentiate itself by leveraging large language models and traditional data analysis methods. The startup is currently in beta, with plans for a broader launch and a focus on product development and engineering recruitment.",
