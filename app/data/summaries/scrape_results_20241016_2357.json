        "Full article text": "OpenAI is broadening access to Advanced Voice Mode, a feature of ChatGPT that allows you to speak more naturally with the AI model. It allows you to interrupt its responses midsentence, and it can sense and interpret your emotions from your tone of voice and adjust its responses accordingly. These features were teased back in May when OpenAI unveiled GPT-4o, but they were not released until July— and then just to an invite-only group. Users who’ve been able to try it have largely described the model as an impressively fast, dynamic, and realistic voice assistant—which has made its limited availability particularly frustrating to some other OpenAI users. Today is the first time OpenAI has promised to bring the new voice mode to a wide range of users. \n\nWhat can it do? Though ChatGPT currently offers a standard voice mode to paid users, its interactions can be clunky. The new version fixes that, and also promises to modify its responses on the basis of the emotion it’s sensing from your voice. As with other versions of ChatGPT, users can personalize the voice mode by asking the model to remember facts about themselves. The new mode also has improved its pronunciation of words in non-English languages. The update also adds new voices. Shortly after the launch of GPT-4o, OpenAI was criticized for the similarity between the female voice in its demo videos and that of Scarlett Johansson, who played an AI love interest in the movie Her. OpenAI then removed the voice. Now it has launched five new voices, which will be available in both the standard and advanced voice modes. \n\nWho can access it and when? For now, OpenAI is rolling out access to Advanced Voice Mode to Plus users, who pay $20 per month for a premium version, and Team users, who pay $30 per month and have higher message limits. The next group to receive access will be those in the Enterprise and Edu tiers. The company hasn’t committed to a firm deadline for when all users in these categories will have access. A message in the ChatGPT app indicates that all Plus users will have access by “the end of fall.” There are geographic limitations. The new feature is not yet available in the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, or Liechtenstein. There is no immediate plan to release Advanced Voice Mode to free users. \n\nWhat steps have been taken to make sure it’s safe? Advanced Voice Mode has been safety-tested by external experts. The GPT-4o system card details how the underlying model handles issues like generating violent or erotic speech, imitating voices without their consent, or generating copyrighted content. Still, OpenAI’s models are not open-source. Compared with such models, which are more transparent about their training data and the “model weights” that govern how the AI produces responses, OpenAI’s closed-source models are harder for independent researchers to evaluate from the perspective of safety, bias, and harm.",
        "Short summary": "OpenAI has expanded access to its Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, allowing users to interact more naturally with the AI by interrupting responses and having the model adjust based on the user's emotional tone. Initially teased with the GPT-4o model, this feature aims to enhance user experience by providing a more dynamic and realistic voice assistant. Currently, access is limited to Plus and Team users, with plans to roll out to Enterprise and Edu tiers. The update includes new voices and improved pronunciation for non-English languages, while also emphasizing safety measures taken during development.",
