        "Full article text": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's international arm launched an updated version of its artificial intelligence-powered translation tool that, it says, is better than products offered by Google, DeepL and ChatGPT. The product supports 15 languages: Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Ukrainian. \"The idea is that we want this AI tool to help the bottom line of the merchants, because if the merchants are doing well, the platform will be doing well,\" Kaifu Zhang, vice president of Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group and head of the business' artificial intelligence initiative, told CNBC. Alibaba's translation tool is based on its own model called Qwen. The new version is based only on large language models, allowing it to draw on contextual clues such as culture or industry-specific terms. Zhang said he expects \"substantial demand\" for the tool from Europe and the Americas. Similar to other AI-based services, the basic pricing charges merchants by the amount of translated text. Zhang declined to share how much the updated version would cost. He said it was included in some service bundles for merchants wanting simple exposure to overseas users. The updated translation engine is going to make Double 11 a better experience for consumers because of more authentic expression. Alibaba's international business includes platforms such as AliExpress and Lazada, which primarily targets Southeast Asia. The international unit reported sales growth of 32% to $4.03 billion in the quarter ended June from a year ago.",
        "Short summary": "Alibaba's international arm has launched an updated AI translation tool that claims to outperform Google, DeepL, and ChatGPT. The tool supports 15 languages and is designed to help merchants improve their sales by providing more contextually accurate translations. The new version utilizes large language models to enhance translation quality, drawing on cultural and industry-specific nuances. Alibaba anticipates significant demand for this tool, particularly in Europe and the Americas, as it aims to bolster its international business amidst slowing growth in its China-focused operations.",
