        "transcript": "In a very short amount of time notebook lm has gone from this kind of unnown tool by google to a powerhouse like now y'all i'm i'm watching the evening news and notebook lm is being talked about so we've already covered it once or twice but they just released some brand new features uh customizable audio and a upcoming business edition uh so today on everyday ai we're going to get you caught up on notebook lm if you haven't already done a deep dive pun intended there but we're also going to go over what's new and do some testing live soh i'm excited about this one and i hope you are too uh what's going on y'all my name's jordan and welcome to everyday ai uh we are your daily live stream podcast and free deadly newsletter helping us all keep up with generative ai and using all of this to get ahead to grow our companies and to grow our careers if that sounds like what you're trying to do awesome you're in the right place uh we do this literally every day weekday monday through friday it's unedited unscripted the realest thing in artificial intelligence uh so if you haven't already please uh make sure to go to your everyday.com if you're listening along on the podcast thank you for tuning in uh we do this thing live too so sometimes we ask for uh audience help we're going to be doing that today but make sure you check out your show notes uh to go to our website and sign up for the daily newsletter all right so before we get into all of these new juicy notebook lm updates that i'm excited for uh let's first start the day as we do every single day by going over the ai news so meta has partnered with bloomhouse to generate short films using movie genen a new suite of ai tools that enables users to create 16-second video clips from text prompts so this new partnership with bloom house features some prominent filmmakers such as anish chag uh chente and casey afflac who are experimenting with ai generated content which could really reshape how stories are told in the future with film uh so while bloomhouse ceo jason bloom sees potential for these tools to enhance creativity the broader adoption of ai in hollywood has sparked some mixed feelings right the whole ai taking our jobs and it being you know too good and replacing small teams so uh an interesting partnership there uh from meta in bloomhouse all right our next piece of ai news open ai has i think launched something that's going to be very popular a desktop app for windows for chat gpt so open ai has just announced the release of its new windows desktop application uh for its popular ai chatbot chat gpt uh so this has already been out for uh on mac for many months but the new windows app is currently available in preview for chat g gpt plus enterprise team and edu subscribers so you have to be a paid subscriber to chat gpt to get access to this uh and open ai's strategy right now goes beyond convenience they're really seeking to deeper uh deepen user engagement uh improve data collection for model enhancement and also create a robust ecosystem that could be difficult for competitors to penetrate uh so yeah this this piece is pretty interesting uh i've been using the desktop app for mac so it came out and uh it's something that really does help your workflow just having uh quicker access to chat gpt uh not always having to you know launch a new tab but it being right on your desktop being able to launch it with a simple uh keyboard command uh pretty cool so hey let me know in the newsletter why don't you reply to the newsletter today let me know if you're going to be using the new chat gbt app uh and then last but not least is a good transition for our show today the notebook lm updates has everyone talking including us today on every a ai all right let's get into the topic today on what's new in notebook lm what you need to know with these new uh advancements and uh if i think you should use it all right it's g to be a fun one today hopefully right doing these things live right that's what we're gonna be doing we're gonna be doing some live examples so for our live stream audience uh i need you to be ready right you can drop some ideas now uh but here's here's some help that that i'm going to need from you all uh one thing that we do right and even my background i was a journalist before all right so i like to say when it comes to ai we're investigative practitioners so we never just take what a company gives us and read it to you on the air we always test things we always try to break things uh we always try to see what's this story that the company doesn't want us to know so we do things live right which if i'm being honest doing any generative ai demo live to thousands of people can not not so much nerve-wracking but it can go terribly wrong uh right so i i hope i can uh count on you all for some good suggestions today so here's here's what i'm going to need a little later i'm gon to need a common skill something that you would want to learn right so as an example uh maybe playing the piano or quantum computing right so what is something that most part for the most part people at least understand what it is but maybe they don't know how to do it so i need a common skill or a common subject that you might want to learn and you can go ahead and get those ideas in now um for our live stream audience that's joining us like jay from grand rapids or christopher from bowling green and kurt from ohio um so i need some examples of a common skill and then a common group of people right so basketball players health care specialists uh eighth graders right it's it's kind of like that old what was it the adlib game right where you you have to kind of fill in the blank that's what we're going to do live to test out these new features in notebook lm all right so if you don't know what notebook lm is don't worry yeah we're going to talk about all the new stuff here in a second but i'm going to first give everyone a very highlevel recap of notebook lm all right so uh it should be in your show notes if you're listening on the podcast but go back and listen to episode 370 did a complete deep dive again that time pun was only half intended because i use deep dive a lot all right uh but here's uh in episode 370 so you can go to your everyday.com go listen to that but essentially this notebook lm is both very similar to other kind of ai chatbots that you've used and it's also completely different okay so it is made by google let's start there um and let's start by clearing some confusion you might be thinking like oh what's notebook lm by google i thought google had that gemini chatbot so yes it does all right and let me also be very honest i'm not a big fan of the front end of gemini so when i talk about front end that is you know if you're an everyday person that's what you're doing right when you go to chat gp.com or gemini.com and you kind of you know log into your account whether you're on a free or a paid account and you use the quote unquote chat bot i'm not a fan of gemini on the front end i think the back end is fantastic google has their ai studio it's probably one of the better backends right um you know chat gbt as an example there's a front end chat gbt is the leader there the back end it's great right the um the assistance api the playground all of that so i'm talking about front end here so this is a new front-end product uh so what that means is with hardly zero uh skill you don't need any skill actually uh you can go in log in on the front end of notebook lm with a google account so you can have a free gmail account or maybe your company has a google workspace all right you can log in it's free right now all right um and it's grounded okay so i'll give you an example of what that means but this is huge and i think everyone is talking about these ai audio overviews these deep dives and that's really what's stealing the show but what i think is when you really even want to know the difference of like hey what's the difference between google gemini and google notebook lm well notebook lm is grounded okay uh and it does so through this isn't traditional rag right rag was kind of the the keyword you know the buzzword in ai a year ago retrieval on men and generation so that's essentially uh before your query goes to a large language model like gemini 1.5 right that's what runs notebook lm is gemini 1.5 so notebook lm is a grounded model so that means if you just go in and if you don't don't add sources if you don't add information you literally can't use it right which is huge uh this is huge right uh and this is i think addresses one of the biggest problems out there uh with large language model and generative ai right now is it's trust it's transparency uh it's explainability it's it's this black box of generative ai notebook lm is so simple right if you don't give it source information it can't do anything you literally can't use it so it is grounded in the information that you provide and you can provide information in a lot of different ways you can copy and paste text in uh you can upload youtube videos uh you can upload files off your computer like a pdf as an example you can connect to google slides google docs um you can upload an mp3 which i like right in that piece right there i got to call this out all right because a lot of people are saying oh it's it's you know what if you're using copyrighted material right you can't have your cake and eat it too and then judge people who are eating the cake so here's what i mean by that if you are an advocate or a user of large language models you've already essentially right which is everyone in the world right you can't not use ai it's it's coming to your devices whether you like it or not uh right but the reality is the way large language models are work work is they scrape content every almost every single thing that's ever been on the internet copyrighted works uh pieces of media offline data sets uh it's all in these large language models so you know i some people are like okay i love you know i love ai i love large language models but oh i'm not so sure about you know uploading content into google lm you know copying and pasting an article or using a youtube video that's not mine guess what that's how all large language models are trained so like i said you can't do something with your left hand and then judge your right hand for doing the same thing all right let's just put that out there um and also are there is is there a further discussion to be had on this absolutely but that's not what we're getting into today all right so uh the way notebook lm works is you upload all of your information then it is grounded it is a a type of retrieval augmented generation and it's different than most chat bots here's here's one of the reasons it doesn't save your chat history right which i think there's there's pros and cons but for most users more cons than pros uh so it works a little differently and i'm going to show you uh i'm going to show you a little bit of on how that works uh here in a minute when we do this live um but you need to save things as notes so it works a little different which i think like i said it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just a little different also the context is huge is huge so you can have 50 sources of up to 500,000 words a piece uh which is 20 5 million words of content uh context right which is mindboggling all right this right now the fact that this is still free for anyone it's wild to me because like i said i think notebook lm is a genius product it solves so many problems right large language models hallucinating not being able to easily work with large amounts of your data right it solves those problems uh also right now it's free for now all right and we have audio overviews and that's really what has blown up the popularity of notebook lm in the last couple of weeks uh when last month in september they announced audio overviews these were essentially it's an ai podcast where two ai hosts you upload all of your documents uh and then they essentially do a you know short anywhere from 3 to 12 minute sometime 15 minute podcast on your content and it sounds very human uh very cool all right so what's new so that's that's what's been out there and y'all if you're not already reading our newsletter we told you about notebook lm like six months ago before all this hype right so if you follow along with us every single day you're gonna be so far ahead even of the people who are quote unquote far ahead just putting that out there right uh that's why we do this every day and we have receipts i can be like y'all i told you about this way before way before it was on cnbc at night or you know msnbc right because now literally everyone's talking about notebook lm so here's what's new so it's out of beta that's a small thing so it's no longer an experimental product they got a new logo so it's it's looking looking a little polished even a new landing page all right uh also there's some new features when it comes to the audio overviews i think that's the big thing so you know people might call these audio overviews they might call them the ai podcast they might call them the deep the deep dive right so those three terms might be using them interchangeably uh but now you can listen to this in the background and then continue to work within your notebook all right and again i'm going to show you guys live what that looks like and how it works the big new feature oh my coffee is not good this morning that's a bummer normally i'm i'm i'm over here sipping on coffee um do do any of you guys i'm just curious do you guys have like a morning routine if if you try to listen you know once or twice a week uh to the show let me know i'm always curious all right so the big thing here i think is customiz able audio interviews all right so this is kind of also i think what made the product go viral uh is because a couple of weeks ago uh you know some smart prompt engineer out there essentially just uploaded one file right so like i said you have to upload a file in order for notebook lm to work and what this person did is they essentially uploaded a i won't say it's a it it was a jailbreak or anything like that but they essentially just uploaded one file and it was essentially script instructions to these ai podcasts essentially like saying something like hey guess what you're an ai and this is weird right react to it you know and then they had this almost uh crisis right the the ai uh the ai podcast the the audio overview deep dive was like the two ai hosts you know going through an existential crisis like oh my gosh we're ai i tried to call home no one was there what's going on right uh and then i think internally google caught win of this and they're like wait you should be able to steer these podcast hosts a little bit because before which i don't think was i i think there's pros and cons before you just put on all your information and then the the two ai hosts just handled it however they quote unquote softfit and i know that's weird uh right to give agency to ais but that's what happens right the the the the ai within google google's notebook lm decided how they could you know what they would make of your podcast right whether you had uh 50 words in there or uh you know five million words essentially uh google decided or notebook lm decided how in in what format they would create your audio overview so now you can customize it uh so that's that's a really big uh new update here that came out and then last but not least uh couple other things that they're testing this isn't out yet but they're uh potentially looking at a mobile app uh and then they're also looking at the possibility to add more than two hosts or additional hosts all right pros and cons on that and then the other big thing here that they announced yesterday is notebook lm for business all right uh this is not out yet uh it's a pilot program right now and you can if you want you can join the pilot so uh presumably that means there's going to be pricing because they talk about pricing all right so uh we assume that this is going to be used for teams uh google says that right now more than 80,000 organizations in millions of users are using notebook lm um and then there's going to be a business edition right now we don't know a ton on what is going to separate this business edition from the edition that or from the free version that is already there and we don't know will this still remain free after a business uh edition launches we're not sure uh right so all we know is that google and notebook lm is really pushing this centralized knowledge base for your team across you know marketing l &d sales customer service etc and the use cases are obviously abundant in their lwh hanging fruit because you've probably tried uploading your data right into the front end of google gemini not very good you probably probably tried uploading your data into the front end of chat gpt maybe using a custom gpt uh okay but still not great you probably tried the same thing in claude using claude projects a little better but still not good right no matter what uh kind of path you've chosen you're always going to deal with hallucinations because the way that most models work is they're not grounded uh so they might first check their own internal data uh they might browse the web uh they might use your data that you've uploaded right so it's kind of a a a a mix right of of how they retrieve the knowledge right and because large language models are generative it's going to do it a little different every time so even when you're uploading your files your knowledge base for your company into claude into google gemini into um chat gpt you know whether you're doing kind of normal chats whether you're building gpts or projects or gems in google results aren't always that consistent and aren't always that good and there's hallucinations and i think that's the problem that notebook lm solves all right uh also both on the personal and the business version uh google does say this they say we value your privacy and never use your organization's data to train notebook lm all right it says as a notebook lm uh business user they also say the same thing for personal users your data will say private to you and whoever you share your notebook with so let me just get the elephant in the room right people are confused they're like okay well right now if it's free if you can upload all of this data right essentially this is a state of the state-ofthe-art rag model which is wild and it's free if you would have told people a year or two ago that this would exist companies literally in early 2022 uh you know mid 2022 right around the chat gpt moment companies literally spent two three four million doar building a version of something like notebook lm but it was way worse and it required a lot of time a lot of money a lot of resources now it's free right like i said you would have told people two or three years ago that this exists they would have said no there's no way it exists it's amazing i talk about ai all day it's fabulous it's like i said i said i think i said this on on the first show uh that i did on notebook lm uh for me notebook lm was more of an aha moment uh for the power of ai than the initial version of chat gpt was right and you all know i love chat gpt uh but when the first version of chat gbt came out in november 2022 i thought it stunk right uh we had been using the gpt technology uh through dozens of other ai tools at that point and it was better right that open ai's technology was better in all of these other tools that had been out for you know a year or more so when chat gbt came out i was like nh not that good uh when notebook lm came out i was like wait what wait zero tech skill free accurate uh grounded right bonkers so why did google make notebook lm then right they have gemini their front-end chatbot and they've spent a bajillion dollars marketing it right super bowl commercials it's there everywhere on the internet right like everyone knows about google gemini so why would they make what seems like uh you know not a competing product but something that's kind of similar right why would they do this well here's one of the reasons and why it's free why i think right it's all about users right right now i don't think the big companies out there so your googles your microsofts open ai anthropic amazon etc they don't care about money they don't they care about users they care about retention right it's literally a gold rush right now all right and think you know oh everyone went out to california in the gold rush right everyone went west think of it it's like different states competing it's like hey come get this gold it's free come get your gold we just want you to settle here we want you to stay here and so far open ai and chbt have been crushing everyone else when it comes to hey stay here right all these companies make you know all this stuff available for either free or $20 a month uh which which is crazy right this is worth hundreds or thousands of dollars a month in terms of what generative ai and large language models can do when you combine it with your data and you have a little bit of skill it is literally worth thousands of dollars a month but for the most part everything's free or $20 20 30 bucks in my opinion this is why google has started to shift uh and invest resources into notebook lm all right so i'm sharing a little uh graphic on my screen here this is data through june 2024 and this is essentially traffic right amongst chat gbt and then its rivals so in june chad gbt had around three billion web visits billion with a b all right and then if you combine combine google gemini perplexity and claude combine those three they did not even get one billion combined all right you don't need to see this chart essentially you know then character ai is another you know uh kind of widely used uh ai system right all of the other biggest ones combined are not even a fraction of chat gbt all right so in my opinion that is i mean companies know this right companies know this they like they know if they're winning or losing uh and right now even if they're winning even if if gemini and claude are uh increasing their user base month over month chat gbt is on a meteoric rise right in terms of being able to attract new users and retain new users right like i said three billion versus the other biggest ones combined are not even at one billion so in my opinion people are always like okay well why why did google launch notebook lm well i think they're taking smart move they're taking a completely different approach to a large language model can work um and the business value it can offer whereas i think you know gemini is it's you know much more steerable it can be much more creative uh that's not notebook lm notebook lm is grounded in your data which i think companies finally realized probably about a year and a half ago where it's like okay cool large language models are cool but what companies really want to do is they want to get their data in there and they want to actually set up some strict guard in terms of working with their data and that's what notebook i think that's what notebook lm right now accomplishes far better than anyone else right and y'all i spent thousands of hours inside all the large language bottles so don't come back to me and say oh jordan have you tried cloud projects yes yes hours a week right hours i try try all these google gems cloud projects uh you know open ai gpts and i teach i've taught thousands of people how to use all this notbook lm is in a class of its own right now all right let's get crazy let's get crazy this could go awful i need some suggestions y'all uh and we're going to do this live and we're going to show you these new features in notebook lm and at the same time uh we're going to see a little bit all right so i need everything from our live stream audience if you didn't get anything already please get some ideas and i'm going to go through them right now all right so i need a common skill right something that you would try to try to learn and that's what i think notebook lm is so good at um and then a common group of people all right uh so let's let's go ahead uh i want to look through some of the ideas so far and please get your idea in here quickly and then we're going to do this uh we're going to do this kind of live all right so let's let's um let's read some of our examples so far all right so angie says a group of people college students i like that christopher is saying uh you know the group of people writers poets or other types of artists uh juggling for retired people i like that one rachel that one made me laugh um okay several people at the retirement center learning to p play cribbage from angie oh i like that idea angie uh my grandparents played cribbage um so i i kind of like that one and i've always wanted to learn cribbage i think i learned it when i was like eight but i forgot uh sabatical life from youtube says learning french uh common group of people churchgoers uh people project managers okay uh let's maybe combine some of these so uh let's do um learning to play cribbage for project managers all right so we're going to combine we're going to combine here all right so here's what we're going to do y'all and uh apologies i'm going to try to keep this uh tight all right but we might go off the rails but hopefully you'll learn something here and podcast audience um i'm gonna be sharing my screen hopefully i'll be able to uh describe this uh enough right you see y'all i use notebook lm all the time look in the past two days i'm sharing my screen right now just in the past two days i've already used it like eight times i use this non-stop right i use this to prepare i used right kind of meta i used notebook lm this morning and last night to prepare for my notebook lm show today all right so here we go so here's what i'm going to do i'm gonna go into new notebook okay and you'll see the first thing it says is add sources so this is what i was talking about earlier you can't just go in and start using this it's grounded in your data all right so i'm just going to show you an example uh under here i'm just going to paste in some text because if i x out of this i literally can't go down here and use it right so uh notebook lm has a familiar interface but um on the leftand side is your sources this isn't your chats okay so this is a notebook so when you go on a notebook on the left-and side is all of your sources that you can upload and you can always add and delete them as you go along uh and then uh on the bottom this is where you will will chat with your sources essentially and then the other thing chats aren't saved so when you exit out of the page all of your chats are going to be gone that's important to know so if you get something very useful that you want to save you will add it as a note all right so anyways i can't go down right now and start typing i'm clicking down here at the bottom you literally cannot use notebook lm until you upload data so let me just give you an example i'm going to go copied text okay so the different ways you can copy you can copy and paste text you can put in a link to a website or a youtube video connect google docs google slides uh or upload files such as pdf text markdown audio so i'm just going to go to copy text i'm going to put in test all right just to show you guys how this works okay so now you'll start to see some of this information fill out all right so now i can start typing so i'm gonna say tell me how to play cribbage okay so here's what's gonna happen it's gonna have no clue even though in a normal large language model this is in its training data but again notebook lm is grounded i know everyone wants to talk about how cool the ai voices are no you guys are sleeping you're missing out i think on the most valuable thing in ai right now is a grounded large language model that has rag built in a state-of-the-art model because it uses gemini 1.5 that only works in your data so the only sources i put in there i put in the word test right so then when i say tell me how to play cribbage it's probably just going to say yo can't do that it's not in it's not in my data right so i say uh tell me how to play cribbage and it says the s you provide do not contain information on how to play cribbage okay so here's what we're going to do here's what we're gonna do y'all all right so i'm i'm in youtube now i'm gonna say how to play cribbage okay so for a youtube video uh it needs to have captions enabled and again i'm gonna say this one more time because people are going to be like oh jordan you're using you know you're using information on the internet that you know you might not have access to guess what it's all in large language models it's all in large language models all right just putting that out there so like i said you can't do one thing with your left hand and then judge your right hand all right so i'm gonna copy the link address to this youtube video all right and hey uh can can can y'all let me know can you see see my screen i hate i hate doing these things live all right so now we're jumping back in and we'll see if this video is allowed uh so i'm going to youtube now so i'm going to add a source and i have the first video that came up when it said here's how to play cribbage i'm going to insert it it may or may not work because it needs um it needs a text transcript and also it needs to be a public youtube video so we might have to try a couple this might not even work so let's see all right perfect the first one actually worked all right so there we go we have a youtube video okay so now i'm going to do something else i'm going to go how to play cribbage i'm going to bring in a couple other sources okay so now i'm on the internet uh here's some website okay so from bicycle playing cards i'm going to copy this um this url and then i'm going to jump back into my notebook i'm gonna add a source on the lefthand side i'm gna click website i'm going to put that website in there this may or may not work we'll see all right cool it worked so now we have two sources uh you know and you can rename these sources so i'm going to say i'm going to rename this to bicycle so cribbage by bicycle so i can remember all right there we go uh and let's do one more just so we can see that you can pull in information from all different places so now i'm going to copy and paste some information i'm gonna go one one more so here we go here's this uh beginner's guide to cribbage all right cool here we go i'm gonna copy and paste all this information so this is from uh instructables i'm going to go to sources add new go to copy text paste it in insert it all right and then over here on the left hand side this is important name your sources all right so i'm gonna rename this one and this is uh instructables cribbage y'all if there's one thing i hate i hate typing live on the show because the way my desk is is set up i'm like crammed and i got my little t-rex arms right okay and i'm actually going to do one more thing um i want to provide a little bit of information uh to notebook lm on what a project manager is all right so i'm g to go to project manager so i'm just saying what does a project manager do all right here we go ha i'm getting a google ai overview all right let's do this let's go to what does a project manager do here we go from teamwork.com i'm going to grab this url i'm going to go into our notebook i also going to name our notebook okay to cribbage i'm g to add this one more source as a website let's see if this one works perfect all right so now we have four sources okay so we have some copy and paste text we have a couple of websites and we have a youtube video okay so now let's go ahead i'm going to generate this right away okay so uh i'm going to show you because i'm going to hopefully play the difference so you can see uh how these this audio overview works so right away i went ahead and uh started to generate the audio overview all right and this one's going to take a couple of minutes it might take uh you know three to five minutes so i probably should have done this a little sooner because i also want to show you all uh how you can uh kind of uh change this and you can influence it so the way that notebook lm talked about this is they said it's like passing a note right so it's like passing a note so think you know you have your two ai podcast uh you know hosts and this new customized feature is like passing them a note on what they can or can't do all right so this is why at first i want to show you kind of the the default uh podcast that will happen because right now it's just going to use all of the different information in there and it's going to use its own uh kind of algorithms to determine what should the audio overview actually be and this one might not turn out the best why because the source information is a little mixed right it's going to see three sources on how to play cribbage and then it's going to see something about project managers so uh we're probably not going to listen to the entire um ai overview because it's probably going to be a little it's gonna be some mixed results right it might be it might still work it might kind of understand okay well it looks like they're trying to learn cribbage and it also looks like there's some information about project manager so maybe they're trying to teach project managers cribbage but maybe not all right so here's what we're going to do next we're gonna let that go all right we're going to let that uh kind of warm up here it's going to take a minute and then let's go ahead and start typing up uh we're going to start typing up our customized instructions so we're going to do a test all right again so we're passing the note here all right we're passing the note and i'm going to do my best to keep my eye on our notebook and once the ai overview is done and you know what we do this live y'all it can be all over the place so if you have any questions about um about notebook lm get them in now because uh when we regenerate our second podcast i might have three minutes to kill all right uh so i'll i'll try to fill it in with some facts and show you around other parts of uh of the notebook uh and some other features which i think are great but you might as well get your questions in live stream audience uh and hopefully i can help uh get some education going uh as we as we go along so let's work on some of these instructions and i want to test them all right and i'll say this i did a a quick reaction video yesterday and i'll say this working in text very very rarely get any hallucinations okay and previously when you left the ai hosts uh to their own accord right they were very accurate for the most part so i did find maybe this is some bugs yesterday but i actually got some hallucinations in the deep dive audio all right not in the normal text right that was still 100% superstellar so i don't know if by allowing users uh a little more freedom to steer the ai audio overview if this is causing maybe some problems with accuracy so as an example yesterday i did the video i'll just tell you the quick takeaway uh what happened was i uploaded a bunch of different sources one of them was avm which was advanced voice mode and all of that was the transcript of uh of a podcast that i did on chat gbt's advanced voice mode and i asked uh the audio overview i gave it some custom you know some of those custom instructions to customize uh the deep dive and it made a lot of stuff up it said avm was an ai company and it said oh it's working with agents and it's not right so it struggled right it struggled a little bit so you know always keep that in mind uh you always need human in the loop and just because this does great and it's a in my experience i've very rarely seen any hallucinations in text right but with this new introduction of kind of this steerable uh audio overview at least in my limited use case i mean it hasn't even been out for 24 hours it kind of went off the rails just a little bit all right so luckily we now have our uh our first round so we're gonna do our second one pretty quickly here we're not going to listen to this whole thing it created a 12 minute podcast all right i'm gonna go ahead sorry i'm gonna put this on like 1.5 and we're just going to listen just to a little bit live stream audience help me out here please let me know if you can hear uh this audio sometimes uh streamyard which i use doesn't stream the audio so here is the 12 minute podcast just a little bit uh on cribbage so let's see how it handles this information here we go all right awesome cool you guys said no audio love when this happens uh even though i test this all the time let's try it one more time all right here we go share the audio share the audio let's try it again all right take two let me know y'all this is you know people always say they they're like jordan do more demos do more demos y'all do you know how hard it is to do demos live when technology hates me all right here we go let me know ready to up your game night because today we're taking a deep dive into the world of cribbage you've shared some fascinating sources with us rule books strategy guides even a visual how-to so by the end of this you'll be well equipped to impress your friends with your cribbage skills what's fascinating about cribbage is that it's not just a game of cards it's a game steeped in history and strategy it's like a blend of poker face and mathematical puzzle all wrapped up in a charmingly old school package i love that poker face in mathematical p speaking of old school our journey starts back in the 1600s with a poet sir john suckling who apparently had a penion for gambling and inventing card games he did and quite a legacy he left behind imagine a smokey pub tanger clinking and this poet gambler introducing his new creation cribbage which actually evolved from a game called um naughty naughty it does have a certain ring to it maybe sir john okay so i ramped up the speed there so you you'll see it didn't do anything with the project managers right which is fine it's actually probably better it kind of uh probably realized oh okay one of these things looks out of place all right so now here's what we're going to do and i was adjusting the speed a little bit here's a little here's a little tip y'all um right now you cannot duplicate notebooks so you might spend a ton of time uh getting all this you know everything in a notebook and all your different sources uh delete right people don't know this you can delete the audio overview and then essentially just regenerate it okay so now i'm going to go to customize and we're just going to customize this slightly so i'm gonna say please start the deep dive aud so again this is the the new feature everyone's talking about this uh you know kind of passing a note to the host so i'm gonna say please start the deep dive audio overview with um uh a uh intro to project managers and why they should learn cribbage i'm going to say please start with a shocking fact that grabs attention and a funny joke all right and then i'm going to say please have the host be i'm gonna say um witty and then i'm going to say please have the host avoid platitudes true is ms cliches and generalities do not use space fillers or needless jargon make sure all words mean something and i'm going to say please end the deep dive audio overview with i'm going to say in analogy uh no i'm gonna say with a i tried this yesterday it didn't really work so i'm gonna say with a pirate joke that resonates with uh project managers trying to learn cribbage so this is incredibly difficult so i know it's going to take a second so let's just go straight in let's start um let's start generating this all right so now when i go to customize i can just paste in all that information all right cool it's not letting me generate it might just be too long let's see okay so i'm going to delete this so i'm gonna have to delete that part about having the host avoid uh platitudes cliches all that all right so now it's generating all right so now uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you some of the other features uh if if there weren't any questions let me just double check let me double check here okay so leslie asking is there a current limit on how long the podcast can be great question leslie so uh you don't have a ton of leeway in the length so uh you can try with the new customizable instructions i try to make some shorter i'd say generally depending on how much source information you have it's going to last anywhere from like six to 15 minutes by default um i tried with this customize uh customizable feature yesterday i i was trying to create a shorter one i got it down to like three minutes so um i don't think as an example you can create an hourlong podcast off of uh you know 10 million words uh i haven't uh specifically tried to make a very very long podcast off a lot of words um but you know who knows maybe maybe that's what i'll do uh next week uh tara says it would be amazing if notebook lm would save these as curated by blank similar to perplexities pages yeah it's actually a great point that terara brings up and i have mixed feelings about this because you have these uh i'll say this you have these very visible uh and influential people in tech now who are essentially just releasing podcasts right on spotify and everywhere else and not very well done uh you know they're just you know releasing these you know 10 15 30 part series using ai and using these hosts so uh yeah i wish i actually wish you couldn't download these because right now you can download them which is you know great use cases right so you can take it on the go you don't need to be connected on the internet uh you know i'm going to be doing some traveling so i might download some of these and listen to them on on on the plane but you know the downside is now people are just spamming right literally there are thousands of these podcasts now and you can tell because it's the same two voice uh voices but you essentially have you know popular you know quote unquote highly visible people people with large audiences just releasing this which i mean like i said there's good parts of that and there's bad parts but i think unfortunately we're going to get spammed so if you are a podcast fan uh going to get spammed with a lot of these podcasts and i wouldn't be surprised if even some of the top podcasts right uh i just realized this because um thanks to you all everyday ai is usually a top 10 podcast um in the us on spotify for tech podcasts and there's like 90,000 and i saw the other day there's a bunch of now just ai generated podcasts up there and i'm like uh and there's people with like big followings and it's like okay part of it it's like okay i can see that but part of me is like oh man that's that's terrible right uh all right any anyways we got our second podcast done already thankfully i don't have to keep uh you know trudging on here so again as a reminder i said please start the deep died overview with an intro to project managers and why they should learn cribbage please start with a shocking fact that grabs attention in a funny joke all right and then i said please end with a pirate joke that resonates so we're essentially going to see how how much can you steer how much can you actually steer this thing all right so let's go ahead take a quick listen and again please let me know audience if we can hear this here we go ever heard of a perfect 29 it's a cribbage score so rare uh you're practically guaranteed to see a unicorn riding unicycle and a rainbow before you ever achieve it in real life but more in that later we're diving into the wild world of cribbage today and you might be thinking cribbage isn't that a game for well let's just say folks who enjoy a leisurely pace that might be the common perception but you'd be surprised exactly because today's deep dive is for all you project managers out there juggling deadlines resources and expectations like a doss we're going to show you how this centuries old card game is practically project management boot camp in disguise we've got our trusty cribbage by bicycle guide a how to play cribbage video by gather together games and even an instructible article for those who like to learn by doing quite the stack of sources what's fascinating is that while cribbage might seem like a simple card game it's been around for centuries cribbage by bicycle tells us it evol all right so again i i cranked the speed up there so we can double check and uh let's just listen to the beginning one more time because it actually hit uh our what we told it to we said hey start with a funny joke um or a shocking fact uh the combination and then talk to project managers on why they need to learn cribbage let's listen one more time just to the first couple seconds ever heard of a perfect 29 it's a cribbage score so rare uh you're practically guaranteed to see a unicorn riding unicycle and a rainbow before you ever achieve it in real life but more on that later we're diving into the wild world of cribbage today and you might be thinking cribbage isn't that a game for well let's just say folks who enjoy al l pace that might be the common perception but you'd be surprised exactly because today's deep dive is for all you project managers out there juggling deadlines resources and expectations like a doss we're going to show you how this centuries old card game is practically project management boot camp in disguise that's wild right it hit it right uh the instructions are a little limited so you can't put in like pages i'll have to do a character count uh but it looks like you could do uh about maybe uh 100 150 words of instructions so uh pretty impressive let's see if it ended so i said please end the deep dive audio overview with a pirate joke that resonates with project managers trying to learn cribbage very specific all right let's see if it uh i'm gna go to the last maybe uh 30 seconds here and let's see if we can pick it up and again i'm playing this between one two and5 speed just so we can get through it you might even discover a hidden talent for counting by 15s and let's be honest after a long day of daun charts and stakeholder meetings a little crib could be the perfect way to unwind and flex those mental muscles in a whole new way indeed though as you play i challenge you to consider this do your cribbage strategies reflect your project management style are you a bold player going for big risks and bigger rewards or are you more calculated and methodical in your approach oh that's a good one it's like holding up a mirror to your decision-making style but in a fun low stake setting and hey even if you don't become the next cribbage champion of the world you'll gain valuable insights that you can apply to your projects and maybe even impress your team with your new found card playing prowess so that wraps up our deep dive into the world of cribbage we hope hope you' enjoyed this journey through the history all you project managers out there all right i didn't see it in the last like 30 seconds i have one question are you ready to add a secret weapon to your project management toolkit cribbage might seem like an unlikely hero but trust me it's more than just a game it's a fun engaging way to sharpen the all right i'll have to go through and listen to this the the full thing here but i didn't on first glance see the ending uh pirate joke uh so maybe it kind of lost track there but i'll make sure to go ahead and recap this all in the newsletter so uh let's wrap this one up and it live stream audience what did you think um and i i i hope i don't need to explain this to you right but i i hope you can already see the enormous potential right uh i think an easy part is learning new subjects right so let's say you're a project manager uh and let's say you need to learn about a new client you need to learn about a new skill set there's a new technology in your field and you're a project manager right uh being able to upload that information uh you know you can have a source that's about yourself you know you could upload a source that's your as an example your disk profile uh you know so you can upload source information about yourself and then you can upload uh source information about whatever project new project you're working on uh about a new technology you're trying to learn about some new news that's impacting your industry and then in the customizable instructions you just tie it together right uh and then that's one thing ai is great at is personalized learning but when you can ground it in facts and stats that are relevant to you that's when i think we i think this is a bigger aha moment than the initial chat gpt because now this is your data and it's personalized to you and like i said uh you know the i think the customizable audio overviews you know there's probably going to be some bugs early on because it when i mean when you think about it it's actually wild technology so you know it had some troubles when i did some testing yesterday it had some hallucinations so this isn't something that i think right now uh you should be hands off the wheel and just trust that every single thing is going to be correct so you know you get still got to do your due diligence still needs to be human in the loop right uh but at least when working with the actual um information here very good so i told you i would i would quickly show you around the rest i'm going to do like a 30- second overview all right so even when you listen to this you can continue to workin card and the other three fivs and the jack of clubs i know that'll be hard to hear but uh just to show you you can listen uh to the audio overview and continue to use other parts of notebook lm so you can click and create these little notes right so an faq a study guide a table of contents a timeline right you can create these all with one click and then i can also go in here and uh chat so i can say you know tell me the three most important tips tips for a project manager to learn cribbage okay and then i click enter uh because i do need to show you kind of one of the most uh okay interesting so it says this question cannot be answered from the given source okay uh so it actually can't combine technically i didn't in my source material even though there's information about project managers and there's information about learning to play cribbage this is a good example there's no stats or facts in there specifically on how project managers can learn cribbage so when i said tell me the three most important tips for a project manager to learn cribbage it can't tell me so now i'm going to do the same thing all right so i'm going to do the same thing and i'm gonna say tell me the three most important tips to learn cribbage and now it should tell me let's see all right so uh there we go so now it's saying here are the three most important tips to learn cribbage that's a great example on how it's not going to infer it's not going to make things up when you are uh working on the text version right when you are chatting with your notebook all right so the good thing is is you can go and click the sources so it's saying you know hey the three most important things are und understand the scoring combinations master the pegging system strategize your discards and then it has little citations for each one so for the first one understand the scoring combinations i can click right so here's citation one and then it takes me to the source this was the cribbage by bicycle and then it highlights so it takes me to that source and it highlights it so you know you can always have a level of confidence i can click number two that's in the same source let me click number five so a lot of this is from the same source that's okay it's probably the best source i'm guessing um so yeah at least in this question it took everything from the same source that's okay uh so now if i want to save this because if i come back it's going to be gone i can just click this save to note all right so then you can toggle your kind of notebook guide on uh and then you can toggle the view chat or close chat and then here's all of my notes right here's all of my save notes so here's the one that i just generated the faq uh the timeline you know those are default options and then the question that i asked and then i saved it as a note so now when i go back uh you know i'll still have all of my sources i'll have save notes but this chat history will be gone so a little different than a standard large language models so i hope this was helpful i know this was a long one uh so if this was helpful please let me know uh it takes us many many hours to plan shows that i hope are helpful for you and your career so if you're listening whether on on twitter or uh linkedin please click that repost or share button uh share this with your network that would mean a lot if you're listening

        "transcript": "In the same way that social media has completely changed the way in which kids grow up and how they interact with their peers artificial intelligence is going to do the same thing except it may be coming at us even faster and have even wider implications than social media did i think this is an important topic to talk about when we talk about generative ai its impact on kids parents and the educational system in total i'm excited for today's conversation what's going on y'all my name is jordan wilson i'm the host of everyday ai this is your daily live stream podcast and free daily newsletter helping you learn and leverage generative ai to grow your companies and to grow your careers so if that sounds like you or if you're just very interested with uh kind of this concept of how ai impacts uh you know how we raise our kids you're definitely in the right place if you haven't already go to your everyday ai.com sign up for that free daily newsletter every day we bring you everything you need to keep up with in the world of ai as well as recapping uh key insights from our interview each day so before we get into the topic today which i'm very passionate about personally i always try to let our guest shine i might have to you know butt in with a hot take here or there uh but let's first go over with what's going on in the world of ai news so google cloud has announced the general availability of vertex ai and its healthcare data engine so google cloud has just launched the general availability of its vertex ai platform and new features for its healthcare data engine so these vertex ai improvements facilitate faster querying of health records and insights gathering enhancing patient care so the integration of gemini in med lm models focus on generative ai applications in healthcare with med lm recognized for its performance on medical licensing exams highlighting its potential impact so a study by google cloud and the harris poll revealed clinicians spend over 28 hours a week yikes on administrative tasks with 80% feeling those duties detract from patient care yeah so uh obviously i think healthcare is a huge uh huge industry about to be disrupted in a good way by ai speaking of disruption in ai nvidia has unveiled a new ai model and on some early benchmarks it's actually outperforming uh big frontier models from open ai and anthropic so nvidia's new model is called llama 3.1 neotron 70b instruct yeah that's the name uh but it is obviously based on meta's open- source llama 3.1 model so essentially all the smart nvidia researchers went in fine tuned it made it better and it's a superhero now so the the model achieved top scores an 85 on the arena hard benchmark as well as a 57.6 on alpha eval 2 all right so we'll we'll share all those dorky benchmarks in the newsletters but now businesses can access the model through nvidia's free hosted inference platform which is build. nvidia.com uh right now nvidia is warning that the model may not yet be suitable for specialized uh specialized tasks in the field that require high accuracy but this move could prompt competitors to accelerate their own development efforts and reshape strategies across various sectors yeah anytime an open source or open weights model goes in and competes with the the the big boys the proprietary models you gotta you got to keep your eyes open all right last but not least the new york times is taking legal action against perplexity over content use so the new york times has demanded that perplexity stop using its content for generative ai purposes claiming it violates copyright law uh in a letter dated october 2nd the times requested that uh perplexity cease all unauthorized access uh to its content uh and provide details on how it has been accessing their website so far perplexity asserts that it is not scraping data but rather indexing web pages yeah the nuances there to provide factual content as citations and responses to user queries the times has obviously previously clashed with open ai and has an ongoing huge lawsuit with them uh and right now perplexity has also faced similar accusations from other media organizations uh all across the board so uh you know make sure to pay attention as we will continue to keep you up to date with this all right but you didn't come here to hear about ai news you came here to listen and to learn uh about why ai literacy right now is essential for parents and kids and education and beyond and don't worry you don't have to hear me just blab on i have a great guest for today so please help me in welcoming to the show there we go we have stephanie warell who's the founder of ai empower you stephanie thank you so much for joining the everyday ai show hey thanks jordan thanks so much for having me um this is such an important topic i was really excited to to come on your show so thank you thanks again for having me all right and hey thank you again for joining us and uh to everyone joining us live thank you please if you have questions for stephanie go ahead and get them in uh you know that's that's one thing people don't know yeah you're probably listening on the podcast but this is a unedited unscripted live stream as well we' like to have fun but stephanie before we get started can you tell everyone just a little bit about what you do uh at ai empower you yes um i am uh the founder of ai empower you and our mission is to educate parents around ai um we we talk about you know safety um education preparation um and you know everything from one-on-one with families to courses um i've got a book out um raising ai smart kids so um the whole mission is really to make sure that uh you know parents help help parents teach and uh educate their kids around ai to make sure that you know you're prepared and they're prepared for the future ai is here it's not going away um don't stick your head we we you know you can't stick your head in the sand anymore uh so it's really to bring awareness around the need for ai and educ so yeah and stephanie you're coming at this from multiple angles so now with your business you know working uh with parents and uh you know trying to improve ai literacy but can you tell everyone really quick about your own uh you know background in the classroom and what you do on the teaching side as well yeah i'm a college professor at uh an adjunct at three different uh universities i teach marketing and communication courses and um the really i mean i have my own kids they're older one 21's 26 but where i really realized that there was a need for it was really a couple years ago as ai generative ai started to come onto the scene um you know i thought this is going to be in the workforce and as an educator um and you know i want my my students to go out into the workforce and be able to like contribute right away feel good about you know that they know what they're doing as much as they possibly can and i'm thinking ai is out there and they're not getting any type of it's not integrated into the curriculum universities are more um more uh centered around right now like figuring out just trying to harness it um in terms of you know plagiarism and that kind of thing well it's not integrated into the curriculum and so when the our students are going out like if i was a co you know you asked me for a a hot take earlier like if i was a college student right now i'd be flipping out um about going out into the workforce um because it's you know you're you're likely not getting a much ai uh integrated into your education right now so you need to you know parents of of college students parents of high school students teenagers like you you you got to make sure your your your kids are educated around ai because when they if you want to live unless you want them living in your basement forever which i guess i wouldn't mind that um but my kids move back and i'm just joking you know you've got to just like we always have we got to prepare our kids for the future yeah stephanie's kids right now about to save on rent they heard that um you know they're coming back to the basement mom so you know stephanie i'm going to ask you about you know kind of both of these major hats that you wear right both as an educator and now as someone working uh with parents but maybe let's start on the lad so what are parents most worried about right now when it comes to not just ai and ai literacy but just in general right because i think this is a seismic shift uh but what are parents worried about right now um the i think most of the parents that i encounter like they i think they're just wored they don't understand it a and then there there's a lot of demon demonizing of it so they're worried about it like i think everybody thinks you know we've seen all the most generations that are probably listening here you know the robot movies are here you know they're worried that robots are going to take over the world and uh parents are worried them about themselves and and what they're if they're going to be able to continue in the workforce so you know a they don't understand it and i a lot of parents are demonizing it which is causing them to stick their heads in the sand so that's that's what i'm seeing right now is like a lot of them are just even ignoring it because they they don't understand it so it's been really interesting when i started doing this i thought oh everyone's going to want to know about this and they need to know about it and um you know it it's been a little bit difficult to like start to warm parents up to the idea that hey it's it's here so you know and and maybe we can learn a little bit through even your personal example so you said you have kids and you know you were you know going through this proba much more educated than the average parent right being a professor in in in marketing and and communications but how did you even approach this you know as a parent maybe walk us through uh kind of how you saw ai's impact happening and uh you know how you uh you know navigated that as a parent yeah um so i started i've got two different kids and it's really interesting i've got one kid that's a scientist and was very opposed to it and thought you know we can't be you know ai's you know she was demonizing it basically and didn't see the value and um you know it's thought and still sometimes thinks it's you know and and there are mis there is misinformation so we need to make sure that's one of the things we educated kids about and parents is like there's a lot of misinformation out there and then i've got another kid that any shortcut he can take to like get his homework done um you know he's there and he's all about it so i had to make sure with one kid the one that's in college right now that that is just starting his freshman year making sure that he understands that you know you you still need to critical think you need to know how to use it you need to use it to enhance your education um but but but just by and it's very easy like you have to write a paper um he was participating in a discussion group not too long you know early in the semester and he thought he could just you know plug it into ai and participate in the discussion and that's plagiarism so we need to make sure you know our kids clear down to like third and fourth grade i was at a dinner table um this summer with third and fourth graders and they were using it to do their math and they were using it to do their papers so so with one kid i i approached it where you know here's the guardrails around it here how here's how you need to use it to enhance um and you know your education then the other one i had to show her the benefits of using it um and that you know it can that you can use it for good um you know she's just recently um starting a new job with the amicor and i helped her use it as she was applying for jobs um with her resume and all of you know her resume or cover letter all those things of course we didn't just plop our information out there and and then out you know out came her resume and her cover letter you know i had her you know she wrote it and then we put it in put it into ai to customize it and it really you know everybody was very impressed with with her resume and her cover letter and it was because we i we did a good job of enhancing it with ai yeah and i think it that's very important to talk about stephanie is this uh you know i say this sometimes the duality of of ai right there's there's a shiny side of this of the coin and then there's a scary side of the coin as well so i think you know we've we we've talked plenty on this show uh about the shiny side right about the uh you know the access to uh to education all the great good that ai can do in the classroom personalized learning all of those things what about the scary side what should parents be aware of when it comes to you know potential risks of ai uh safety all of those things yeah safety is a is a big part of what i talk about with parents and you know basic internet hopefully parents at this point have you know basic internet you know you know make you your sc boundaries around it those kind of things but the scary side of it u if you don't and you're not monitor first have the conversation know because your kids are probably using it so uh have the conversation understand how they're using it but you know right now um we were just talking about a a case in uh massachusetts the hingham school district there was a a kid that they the parents just sued the school district and the i believe the teacher because they were accusing him of plagiarizing um a paper that he had done and really had he had been using it like google to do his background research so the scary side of it is you know you need to understand how your kids are using it so if something like that happens you you can deal with it as a parent with the school d district and know whether your kid how they used it how they're using it whether they plagiarized or not um deep fakes are out there we're seeing that with um celebrities uh you know taylor swift and multiple um celebrities but it's also happening to young kids um you know with pornography and those kind of things and that with the video capabilities which you talk about a lot you know um it's becoming more and more advanced and so it can look like your child is starring in a porn movie basically so we need you need to make sure that you at your kids around that and then the other thing that i worry about is it's with ai is it you know you put information in you put questions in it can answer you back and so you know we've got social media um and now we're going to layer ai and it has the ability to talk back to you and so kids are starting to develop relationships versus you know with with with with ai versus you know versus other others kids other students uh with their families and so you know deep fakes plagiarism and and uh you know and and and just making sure that kids are having real relationships with people and they aren't like diving into uh you know you know instead of dating or or having friendships that you know they're developing meaningful relationships yeah it's it's an important call out stephanie because i think maybe some parents when they think of ai or generative ai they just think of chat gpt right and they just think of text on a screen right not knowing that you know these large language models are multimodal right knowing hey chat gpt on the phone you can literally pick up and start talking to it and it'll talk back to you right luckily the guard rails are okay uh you know at least in this first version but fr uh i do believe future versions of this technology will have fewer guardrails right so you know you kind of talked about hey parents need to have like they would like they need to have some sort of rule or guidelines like they would on the internet uh or or maybe similar uh to to social media so how can parents find that balance right because number one this is brand new right like this is coming fast it's changing and updating uh every day so that's that's number one but number number two like we've never been here before we don't have any uh you know barometer to to go back and say oh this is like you know 15 years ago when this happened so how can parents find that nice balance of of using ai for the good but keeping up and keeping their kids away from all of the bad yeah i mean just like i talked about have a conversation understand how they're using it more than likely if they're fifth grade or older they're using it in some way and they're also i mean there's kh academy that's already in the schools so that you know your kids are already using it you probably just don't know about it and so you know having the conversation and then setting boundaries around it so understanding what they're using it for so if they're using chat gbt how they're using it if they're still using their you know critical thinking um understand what's out there because you know we've talked a lot about the negative side of it but there's a lot of positive um one of the big positives for me was i wish i would have had this when i was a parent and we haven't been there before is the homework hell in the evenings you know so you're the kids are hry you're hangry they're trying to get their ma you know you're trying to get math i didn't i was i'm not a math student you know under you know educating yourself how to use chat gbt there's photo maath like how help two to your own kids to do homework like you don't turn you don't sit your kid popping down in front of the computer and say hey chat help them do their homework like you're like like using it as a tutor you know we um so that that can be really helpful so um you know using it for the good understanding what the good is um so setting boundaries starting the conversation understanding how to use it for the good um and then you know just basically um under you know keeping yourself up to dat um one of the things that i do is i have a parent community that you can join and so talking to each other um you know seeing what's happening with kids um i think is a good is good so you know i love that example of you know don't just sit your kid in front of chat gpt and say help right uh make it a collaborative experience which uh i think is a is a great point right because not only can it bring personalized learning to students that can bring you know personalized tutoring to uh student parents combos right and to help the two of you through it can help parents be better uh you know educators for their children which i think is often an overlooked aspect of of ai uh but what about the you know you kind of referenced earlier uh stephanie about some of these downsides but maybe even what about its potential toll on like mental health right uh that's obviously you know i think social media personally i i hate social media right like i i'm not on anything aside from like you know linkedin or reading news on twitter uh but i'm not on facebook and instagram and snapchat and all these tik toks right i i i don't touch those because i think that they can have a real negative impact on people is ai can it have a similar negative impact on mental health yeah absolutely and i started to touch on it but um you know you're you're absolutely right and i because of what i do in my work um and then you know and trying to get a message out i do i work i you know i i am on social media um and so you know we we layer ai on top of that where you know you can it ai can again have a conversation with you and you can isolate yourself and you know some of our kids that are you know in college right now have already been isolated because of covid and they're already having me mental health issues and they started to isolate themselves to social media um i know numerous kids maybe even one of my own that started to do that during social media and we're still trying to get her out of that out of that mode where you know you are building relationships with other people and so and it can tell you what to do i mean this is an example of a a a kid or a parent but um there was a reporter and i think from the new york times that started talking to chat gbt and ultimately it started talking to him about divorcing his wife so you know that you know that you know i've not seen that happen but you know you don't know you don't know where all that data is coming from and and so you know and it is starting to personalize and talk to you um you know i can put in you know i'm a gemini and it can you know give me my astrological readout for the day um so it can start to get really personal and so we've got to make sure that our kids just aren't talking to the computer they aren't you know kids a lot of kids are you know gaming and social media they're spending all their time on the computer that was something that we fought with the kids growing up and now it's there's even more of a reason you know they can actually have a what they think might be a meaningful conversation with ai so you know it it it layers on the mental health issues that could can happen with social media so you're absolutely right yeah and and maybe now stephanie if we can put on your other hat right so we just talked a little bit uh about parents and kids uh you know the the younger demographic but now let's talk a little bit about what you do on the other side right educating college students um what's what's your take on even ai literacy in college students and you know i'm glad actually you know adjunct at three different uh you know three different places so you probably have a nice uh more balanced viewpoint than if you were in just one but overall right how would you explain uh the current landscape of ai use in colleges and what should even parents of college age kids be looking out for yeah i mean it's the same as when you're i mean just basic things that we worry about when our kids are in college is you know i i mean i don't think my kids would do this but you never know like plagiarizing and all the things that we you know worry about as college students but um the again the thing that i really i really started to hone in on is we're starting to see all these ai tools out there that that like even like grammarly um you know things like that like i i i suggest all of my students use grammarly um so they're not writing their paper with with ai but they're using grammarly to uplevel their you know their their work and so as i'm teaching and working with i'm trying to introduce them to those kind of tools so they're not like i said it's not doing the work for them it's enhancing them it's help it's brain it's helping them brainstorm um so introducing them to tools that they can use when they that they're immediately going to see i mean obviously they're gonna likely see chat gbt so at least introducing them to chat gbt and the right ways to using it um you know and and things you know i also work with um professionals in the communications industry so things that you know trans around transparency making sure people know that you are using ai how to use it what the tools are out there um and then the job landscape is starting to shift um so the other thing is teaching kids how to uh and students not all of them are kids some of them are older um you know what how to look for jobs you know job searches what's out there um you know should they be learning how to code um you know really just getting the basic fundamentals uh ai in the classroom so that they aren't shocked when they go out because their peers are going to be using it in different ways so really it's all about i i really emphasize preparing yourself and you know a lot of like i said a lot of the schools right now are all about either getting an ai tool so they can say they have ai in their in their schools or they're work just working around about around the guard rails um you know preventing uh plagiarism and those kind of things so we want i mean the it's scary enough for a a student to graduate um and you know that senior year they're all they're already worried about getting a job and now we're layering on top of that a whole new technology that they that normally like we always think about i mean i always thought about young people like oh yeah social media uh inter you know wi-fi internet all those things you know young kids have a grasp on that we we turn to them to help understand that and they're getting that at the university level well it's not happening at this point and it's it it we we we've got to make sure that it's it's introduced in our curriculum yeah and a lot of a lot of great points there to to unravel stephanie i think you know one uh one important thing to talk about you know i know like as an example you mentioned grammarly right because i think early on in the you know generative ai wave you know that's where everyone looked they're like okay well grammarly and right but you have to keep up because things always change and now grammarly for the most part can function exactly like chat gpt right you can have literally a blank screen and you can have grammarly essentially write your paper right or improve it but you know i think that's another thing that's important to to call out is all these tools are are changing and even you know tools that you might have thought as traditionally oh okay it's great if my child uses grammarly at all times i'm not saying it's bad right it's still great but you know even the features and functionalities of what all these other ai tools can do uh changes constantly um and one one other thing that i wanted to dive into a little bit deeper here uh is is you you talked about preparedness uh right and and students coming out of college feeling prepared i think there's some universities that are doing great at this right and they're uh introducing generative ai uh in a responsible ethical way and teaching students what they need to know there's some schools that i think are completely dropping the ball and still just blanket uh blanket banning uh all ai which is the most in demand skill when students get out in the workforce so from your perspective how should schools be tackling this maybe a little bit better maybe a little bit more uniformly to to make sure students when they leave college are prepared and have these essential skills yeah um we need to be looking at we we need to be working with the professors and you know the teachers and and making sure that it is introduced into the curriculum so when you're writing your syllabus for the semester you know you're thinking about how generative ai um you know plays into this subject whether even if it's a history course you know how generative ai um plays into the subject you know and then when we're we get you know as as a preparing curriculum for students um at the upper level is where you're taking courses that are more related to your major and what you're going to be doing when you get out really making sure that you're you know you have um you know even if you're you as a professor are not uh all up to speed on generative ai there's lots of speakers out there that you can bring in experts um you know people like myself um lots there there are experts in ai that you can bring into the classroom so bringing that perspective and exposing i mean i was i'm most most teachers are already doing that like bringing guest speakers in so that they understand i know when i teach marketing and communications like i want individuals to come in professionals that come in that are talking to them about what the profession is like now um so that when they get out they're not surprised so making sure we're just making sure we're integrating it in and you know even companies are banning it i mean it's sort of like social media i don't you i don't know if you remember this but in my profession when social media started to roll out i was like oh my gosh no we can't be doing that you know at the corporate level like we can't let anybody on social media um we that we can't take that stance with ai um all around in our education in our profession we've got to be open to it and we got to get up to speed so uh we've covered a whole lot today stephanie uh from you know some of the potential misuses and dangers of you know kind of unsupervised ai and kids and some of the scary things and why it's important for parents to be actively involved and we went all the way through right all the way through college and you know why it's important for universities to uh equip students with ai skills but as we wrap up here maybe what is the one most important takeaway uh right so with parents out there listening uh students out there listening what is your one most important takeaway when it comes to why ai literacy is so important for parents and kids yeah um well my one main message is don't stick your head in the sand like get on the get on the bus educate yourself and then you know why parents should educate themselves i mean not only can it benefit yourself you as a parent it i talked about the homework aspect of it it can make you a better parent i use it for organization um you know nutrition um my schedule i mean it can really enhance your job as a parent and help educate yourself as a parent um help you have a better relationship with your kid i don't know um you know about you out the the parents out there listening but you know the homework health stuff really it can put a a you know rift between it's not it's not fun so making sure that you know you understand how to use it to be up to enhance yourself as a parent and then again preparation um you know your kids are going to be exposed to it and they need to be prepared and they need to know what to do just like with social media you know if something happens they need to know what to do if something happens like a deep fake so you know just and then just preparing your kids for the future so that they um you know they aren't afraid of it and they uh can get jobs they can be gainfully employed and you know stay out of your basement in the future so he hey that's always what parents want to hear right how can we ensure the kids get out of the basement uh stephanie this was uh a great conversation to have uh i i i think it's important that we talk about this you know ai literacy and kind of how it plays into our our you know impact in the roles of a parents have with their kids so thank you so much for taking time out of your day to join everyday ai and help our audience better understand this we
