  Avoid repeating information across different sections.
  Ensure each section adds unique value to the overall content.
Relevance:
  Focus exclusively on AI/ML-related content, omitting unrelated topics to maintain clarity and purpose.

Focus only on content directly related to Artificial intelligence, generative AI, machine learning, AI innovations, and industry trends. If the article is not primarily about AI/ML topics, summarize only the relevant sections if exists. Avoid including any images, videos, or other media. Do not add any data from your own knowledge. If there is not enough text/data, simply state: "There is not enough extracted data."
