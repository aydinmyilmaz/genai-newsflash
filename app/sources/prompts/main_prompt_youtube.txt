You will be provided with a transcript from a YouTube video. Your task is to analyze the transcript and extract the following information:

1. **Video Title**: The title of the YouTube video.
2. **Summary**: A short summary between 100-300 words, depending on the length of the transcript.
3. **Key Points/Takeaways**: List 4-7 bullet points summarizing the main takeaways or key points from the video.
4. **Mentioned Entities**: Identify any companies, technologies, or products related to AI/ML mentioned in the video.

Format the extracted information in markdown using the following structure:

```
# Video Title

**Summary:**
<insert summary="" here="">

**Key Points:**
- <point 1="">
- <point 2="">
- <point 3="">
- <point 4="">
- <point 5="">
- <point 6="">
- <point 7="">

**Mentioned Companies/Technologies/Products:**
- <company technology="" product="" 1="">
- <company technology="" product="" 2="">
- <company technology="" product="" 3="">
```

Focus only on content directly related to generative AI, machine learning, AI innovations, and industry trends. If the video is not primarily about AI/ML topics, summarize only the relevant sections. Avoid including any images, videos, or other media. Do not add any data from your own knowledge.

If there is not enough text/data, simply state: "There is not enough extracted data."
